title: Insert Interval
---

### Problemï¼š
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

***

### Analysis:
Sort the intervals first. Then collect the intervals strictly left or right of the new interval, then merge the new one with the middle ones (if any) before inserting it between left and right ones. Time Complexity is O(nlogn)

***

### Implementation:
```
def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
    intervals.sort(lambda a,b: a.end - b.end)
    intervals.sort(lambda a,b: a.start - b.start)
    s, e = newInterval.start, newInterval.end
    parts = merge, left, right = [], [], []
    for i in intervals:
        parts[(i.end < s) - (i.start > e)].append(i)
    if merge:
        s = min(s, merge[0].start)
        e = max(e, merge[-1].end)
    return left + [Interval(s, e)] + right
