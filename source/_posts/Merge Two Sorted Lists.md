title: Merge Two Sorted Lists
---

### Problem:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

***

### Ayalysis:
Basic idea is start from a List, growing it node by node.

In solutions we have a dummy head, and a tail called current indicating last node in this growing List. At each step we append either l1 or l2 to tail, and update tail, l1 or l2 accordingly.

***

### Implementation:

Iteratively
```
def mergeTwoLists1(self, l1, l2):
    dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            cur.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            cur.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        cur = cur.next
    cur.next = l1 or l2
    return dummy.next
```


Recursively
```
def mergeTwoLists2(self, l1, l2):
    if not l1 or not l2:
        return l1 or l2
    if l1.val < l2.val:
        l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
        return l1
    else:
        l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next)
        return l2
```

Iteratively （In place）
```
def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
    if None in (l1, l2):
        return l1 or l2
    dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = l1
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            nxt = cur.next
            cur.next = l2
            tmp = l2.next
            l2.next = nxt
            l2 = tmp
        cur = cur.next
    cur.next = l1 or l2
    return dummy.next
```
