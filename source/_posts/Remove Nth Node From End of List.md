title: Remove Nth Node From End of List
---

### Problem:
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

```
For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

Note:
Given n will always be valid.

Try to do this in one pass.

***

### Analysis:
A one pass solution can be done using pointers. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.

Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place. Otherwise, this would be necessary. Time Complexity is O(n)

***

### Implementation:
```
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        fast = slow = head
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
