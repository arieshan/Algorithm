title: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
---

### Problem:
Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.

*** 

### Analysis:
Use a dummy head and start from it. Do simple single list operation and go through the list. The Time Complexity is O(n)

***

### Implementation:
```
def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
    dummy = pre = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    while head and head.next:
        if head.val == head.next.val:
            while head and head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                head = head.next
            head = head.next
            pre.next = head
        else:
            pre = pre.next
            head = head.next
    return dummy.next
```
